Anonymous Mental Health Support
Students face growing mental health challenges from academic pressure, social stress, and personal issues, yet many hesitate to seek help due to stigma or fear of judgement.
Existing resources often lack anonymity or are not tailored to students' needs, creating a gap in accesible, confidential support. 
An innovative solution is needed to address these challenges, offering both preventive and responsive strategies to support student mental health.
